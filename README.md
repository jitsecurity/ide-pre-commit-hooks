# IDE Extension pre-commit hooks
A set of pre-commit hooks to use along with the IDE Extension.

## Getting Started
Instructions for how to set up and use your pre-commit-hooks. This should include any dependencies that need to be installed, and any configuration steps that need to be performed.

## Usage
Once the pre-commit hook is installed and configured, it will automatically run whenever you try to commit changes to your repository. If there are findings in the specified file, the commit will be blocked and you will need to address the findings before committing again.

## Configuration
You can configure the pre-commit hook by modifying the parameters in the IDE Extension settings.
